    /// vsync on a typical 59.97Hz monitor, you might prefer to just get one
    /// fixed update per frame anyway, instead of occasional hickups/jitter
    /// due to the subtle mismatch between the fixed timestep and the real rate.

    /// than `exit_deviation` timestep durations, leave "locked mode".
