//! Composable Alternatives to Bevy's RunCriteria, States, FixedTimestep
//!
//! This crate offers alternatives to the Run Criteria, States, and FixedTimestep
//! scheduling features currently offered by the Bevy game engine.
//!
//! The ones provided by this crate do not use "looping stages", and can therefore
//! be combined/composed together elegantly, solving some of the most annoying
//! usability limitations of the respective APIs in Bevy.
